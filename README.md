# Restaurant-Menu

This project consists of a web application that queries a database for items on restaurant menus and then dynamically generates complete menus in the form of web pages and API endpoints. The project uses Flask & SQLAlchemy.

This project was developed with the help of Udacity's [Full Stack Foundations](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-foundations--ud088) and [Authentication & Authorization: OAuth](https://www.udacity.com/course/authentication-authorization-oauth--ud330) courses. Taking these courses will help you build a similar restaurant menu web application from scratch.
